kubectl expose deployment nginx-pvc-deployment --type=NodePort --port=80
kubectl expose deployment nginx-pvc-deployment --type=NodePort --port=80
 is a command used in Kubernetes to create a NodePort service that exposes your nginx-pvc-deployment. 
This command will:
1. Look up the deployment named nginx-pvc-deployment.
2. Use the selector of that deployment to select the pods running your nginx application.
3. Create a new Kubernetes service of type NodePort.
4. Configure the service to listen on port 80.
5. Route traffic from port 80 on the service to the pods matching the deployment's selector.

When you run wget http://localhost:30395 from inside the debug-pod, localhost (or 127.0.0.1) refers to the network interface of the debug-pod itself.
Your Nginx service (nginx-pvc-deployment) is listening on its own Pod's IP address on port 80, and the NodePort service (which has IP 10.96.170.116 and port 80:30395/TCP) provides a way to access that service.
So, from inside your debug-pod, localhost:30395 means "try to connect to my own Pod on port 30395", which doesn't have Nginx running on it, nor is port 30395 open on the debug pod. That's why you get "Connection refused."

# From inside the debug-pod 
/ # wget http://nginx-pvc-deployment:80
